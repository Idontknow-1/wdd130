            Hello! My name is Iztamaude Mera-Lagos. My name means woman gift from God. I go by Izta (east-a). I live in
            Casa Grande, Arizona.
            I am married and we have a beautiful 2 month old boy named Mathayus.
            I served my mission in Honduras, the San Pedro Sula East Mission. That's where I met my husband from Peru.
            I have always been passionate about art and creating. I love to make inticrate nail art, from 3D designs to
            portraits.
            I found my love for coding through BYU Pathway.

        <h2>Arizona, U.S.A</h2>

        <p>
            My state is known for being the hottest state in the U.S.A.
            Temperatures usually rise above the 100 degrees throught the whole summer, which seems to get longer with
            every passing year. Although very hot, there are many beautiful places to enjoy the heat.
            You can go tubing down the Salt River or you can go to various lakes around Arizona.
            The capitol city is Phoenix, which is were i was born. There is always a lot to see. Many enjoy cruising in
            Downtown Phoenix.
            Although Arizona is a dessert, many places more up North have beautiful greenery like Sedona and Flaggstaff.
            For cooler weather and snow, those are the places to be.
